## Rock Paper Scissors :scissors:
I'm currently working my way through Paul Hudsons [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course, to further my knowledge of SwiftUI.

The prompt to build this project was given as a challenge in the course. 

> The game itself is good old Rock, Paper, Scissors. The user should attempt to beat the bot at each turn, but it comes with a twist. You will also be prompted to either deliberately win or lose against the bot. If you get "Rock" and "lose", you should choose scissors for example.
